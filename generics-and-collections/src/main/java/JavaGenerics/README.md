# Generics
## Why we need a generic type?


## Raw type and nuance 
- generic class can be used without mentioning generic. this is called raw type
- 

## bounding types: upper bound, lowe bound, wild card
- type safety
- bounded generic
- interface also extends
- & can be user (eg: T extends class & interface) Note: class first and interface next
- <T> in method.
